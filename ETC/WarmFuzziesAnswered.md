I love digital and hardware design. It would be great to get involved in the development of new products or maintenance of existing products. I also enjoy writing code - especially low level and designing circuits. These three areas are my preferred ones:

-Digital/Hardware Design
-Writing code libraries for products
-Designing circuits diagrams for product
